## First steps

#### Create following folders into `app` folder:
- `controller`: Contains controllers with views logic. **Important:** controllers files must be called `<name>Controller.php`.
- `model`: Contains database models abstractions.
- `view`: Contains templates. You can overwrite `core` views creating again here.
- `lib`: Contains user libs and helpers.
